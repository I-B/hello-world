An introductory repository for storing ideas, resources, sharing and discussion with others. Especially when it comes to suggesting and developing something a little bit more effective than the latter.

"This planet does - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely concerned with the movement of small, green pieces of paper, which was odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy."
~ Douglas Adams, The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy
